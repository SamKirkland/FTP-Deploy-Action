# How to migrate between versions

## Migrating from v4.1.0 to v4.2.0

`v4.2.0` parses the `exclude` option in a more standard way. Going forward the `exclude` option **must** be in the following format:

```yml
exclude: |
  **/.git*
  **/.git*/**
  **/node_modules/**
  fileToExclude.txt
```

## Migrating from v3 to v4

Migrating from v3 to v4 should be fairly straightforward. Version 4 was designed with speed and ease of initial setup in mind. Going forward version 4 will be the only supported version.

### Those who can't upgrade

Most features have been carried forward and improved upon. However, some features did not make the cut:
- **`sftp` is no longer supported**. If you have `sftp` access you are using `ssh`, that means you have access to a much more modern and capable protocol. I plan on releasing a separate github action that will deploy over `sftp`/`ssh` using `rsync`. Until then you can continue using version 3.
- The `include` argument has been removed. I didn't see much need for it in the initial release. If you need this feature please create a support ticket.

### How to upgrade

1. Remove `with: fetch-depth: 2`. It is no longer needed and removing it will _slightly_ speed up deployments.
2. Change the version to `v4.X.X`, for example `SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action@v4.3.4` (please check the [README](https://github.com/SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action/blob/master/README.md) or the [releases page](https://github.com/SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action/releases/latest) for the latest version).
3. If you have a `.git-ftp-include` file you should delete it. Version 4 tracks files differently and no longer needs this config file.
4. If you have a `.git-ftp-ignore` file, you should transfer the options to the new `exclude` argument. **Note:** version 4 excludes any `.git*` and `node_modules/` files / folders by default.
5. Update your arguments to reflect the following changes:
    - `ftp-server` was split into 4 arguments:
        - `server`
        - `port`
        - `protocol`
        - `server-dir`
    - `ftp-username` was renamed to `username`.
    - `ftp-password` was renamed to `password`.
    - `local-dir` and `server-dir` now **must** end with `/`.
    - `git-ftp-args` and `known-hosts` arguments were removed.

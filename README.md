### Usage Example
Place the following in `/.github/workflows/main.yml`
```yml
on: push
name: ðŸš€ Deploy website on push
jobs:
  web-deploy:
    name: ðŸŽ‰ Deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: ðŸšš Get latest code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
    - name: ðŸ“‚ Sync files
      uses: SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action@4.3.3
      with:
        server: ftp.samkirkland.com
        username: myFtpUserName
        password: ${{ secrets.ftp_password }}
```

---

### Requirements
- You must have ftp access to your server. If your host allows or requires ssh please use my [web-deploy](https://github.com/SamKirkland/web-deploy) action
- Some web hosts change the default port (21), check with your host for your port number

---

### Setup Steps
1. Select the repository you want to add the action to
2. Select the `Actions` tab
3. Select `Blank workflow file` or `Set up a workflow yourself`, if you don't see these options manually create a yaml file `Your_Project/.github/workflows/main.yml`
4. Paste the example above into your yaml file and save
5. Now you need to add a key to the `secrets` section in your project. To add a `secret` go to the `Settings` tab in your project then select `Secrets`. Add a new `Secret` for `password`
6. Update your yaml file settings
7. If you appreciate this github action give it a :star: or show off with one of the [badges below](#badge).

---

### Settings
Keys can be added directly to your .yml config file or referenced from your project `Secrets` storage.

To add a `secret` go to the `Settings` tab in your project then select `Secrets`.
I strongly recommend you store your `password` as a secret.

# Common Examples
#### Build and Publish React/Angular/Vue Website
Make sure you have an npm script named 'build'. This config should work for most node built websites.

```yml
on: push
name: ðŸš€ Deploy website on push
jobs:
  web-deploy:
    name: ðŸŽ‰ Deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: ðŸšš Get latest code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Use Node.js 16
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '16'
      
    - name: ðŸ”¨ Build Project
      run: |
        npm install
        npm run build
    
    - name: ðŸ“‚ Sync files
      uses: SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action@4.3.3
      with:
        server: ftp.samkirkland.com
        username: myFtpUserName
        password: ${{ secrets.password }}
```

#### FTPS
```yml
on: push
name: ðŸš€ Deploy website on push
jobs:
  web-deploy:
    name: ðŸŽ‰ Deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: ðŸšš Get latest code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: ðŸ“‚ Sync files
      uses: SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action@4.3.3
      with:
        server: ftp.samkirkland.com
        username: myFtpUserName
        password: ${{ secrets.password }}
        protocol: ftps
        port: 1234 # todo replace with your web hosts ftps port
```

#### Log only dry run: Use this option for testing
Ouputs a list of files that will be created/modified to sync your source without making any actual changes
```yml
on: push
name: ðŸš€ Deploy website on push
jobs:
  web-deploy:
    name: ðŸŽ‰ Deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: ðŸšš Get latest code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: ðŸ“‚ Sync files
      uses: SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action@4.3.3
      with:
        server: ftp.samkirkland.com
        username: myFtpUserName
        password: ${{ secrets.password }}
        dry-run: true
```

#### Exclude files
Excludes files
```yml
on: push
name: ðŸš€ Deploy website on push
jobs:
  web-deploy:
    name: ðŸŽ‰ Deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: ðŸšš Get latest code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: ðŸ“‚ Sync files
      uses: SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action@4.3.3
      with:
        server: ftp.samkirkland.com
        username: myFtpUserName
        password: ${{ secrets.password }}
        exclude: |
          **/.git*
          **/.git*/**
          **/node_modules/**
          fileToExclude.txt
```

`exclude` has the following default value
```yml
exclude: |
  **/.git*
  **/.git*/**
  **/node_modules/**
```
if you overwrite the default value you will probably want to respecify them

## FAQ
<details>
  <summary>How to exclude .git files from the publish</summary>

Git files are excluded by default! If you customize the `exclude` option make sure you re-add the default options.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How to exclude a specific file or folder</summary>

You can use the `exclude` option to ignore specific files/folders from the publish. Keep in mind you will need to re-add the default exclude options if you want to keep them. For example the below option excludes all `.txt` files.

```yml
exclude:
 - *.txt
```

</details>


<details>
  <summary>How do I set a upload timeout?</summary>

github has a built-in `timeout-minutes` option, see customized example below

```yaml
on: push
name: Publish Website
jobs:
  web-deploy:
    name: web-deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 15 # time out after 15 minutes (default is 360 minutes)
    steps:
      ....
```

## Debugging your config locally
This action is a basic wrapper around my `@samkirkland/ftp-deploy` npm package. To test your config you can install [@samkirkland/ftp-deploy](https://github.com/SamKirkland/ftp-deploy) and then convert your config to a yml action. Settings are one-to-one, this action is only a wrapper.

## Contributing to this project
To test this action locally you will need to setup **docker** and **act** to run a environment similar to the one github uses for actions.
- Download/install docker for windows, make sure it is running
- `choco install act-cli` install [act](https://github.com/nektos/act)
- Install the npm package using `npm install --dev-only @samkirkland/ftp-deploy`
- Update the `deploy` script in `package.json` with a actual server/username/password
- You can run the script using the following command `npm run deploy` (run this in the folder that has the `package.json` file)
